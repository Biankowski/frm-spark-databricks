## Demo Structure

### 1. Time Travel Fundamentals

Delta Lake's time travel allows you to query historical versions of your data:

#### **Version-Based Time Travel**
```python
# Read specific version
df_v0 = spark.read.format("delta").option("versionAsOf", 0).load(table_path)
df_v1 = spark.read.format("delta").option("versionAsOf", 1).load(table_path)

# Compare versions
print(f"Version 0: {df_v0.count()} records")
print(f"Version 1: {df_v1.count()} records")
```

#### **Timestamp-Based Time Travel**
```python
# Read data as of specific timestamp
df_historical = spark.read.format("delta") \
    .option("timestampAsOf", "2024-01-01 10:00:00") \
    .load(table_path)

# Using SQL syntax
spark.sql(f"""
    SELECT * FROM delta.`{table_path}` 
    TIMESTAMP AS OF '2024-01-01 10:00:00'
""")
```

### 2. Table History Analysis

#### **DESCRIBE HISTORY Command**
```sql
-- SQL approach
DESCRIBE HISTORY delta.`s3a://path/to/table`

-- Shows: version, timestamp, operation, operationParameters, etc.
```

#### **Delta Table History API**
```python
# Programmatic approach
delta_table = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, table_path)
history_df = delta_table.history()

# Analyze operations
history_df.select("version", "timestamp", "operation").show()

# Get operation metrics
history_df.select("operationMetrics").show(truncate=False)
```

### 3. RESTORE TABLE Operations

Restore tables to previous versions when data issues occur:

```sql
-- Restore to specific version
RESTORE TABLE delta.`s3a://path/to/table` TO VERSION AS OF 2

-- Restore to specific timestamp
RESTORE TABLE delta.`s3a://path/to/table` 
TO TIMESTAMP AS OF '2024-01-01 10:00:00'
```

**Use Cases for RESTORE:**
- **Data corruption recovery**: Roll back to known good state
- **Bad deployment rollback**: Undo problematic data changes
- **Testing scenarios**: Reset to baseline for testing
- **Compliance requirements**: Restore to audit-required state

### 4. VACUUM Operations

Manage storage by cleaning up old data files:

```sql
-- Dry run (see what would be deleted)
VACUUM delta.`s3a://path/to/table` RETAIN 168 HOURS DRY RUN

-- Actual vacuum (default 7 days retention)
VACUUM delta.`s3a://path/to/table`

-- Custom retention period
VACUUM delta.`s3a://path/to/table` RETAIN 240 HOURS
```

**VACUUM Considerations:**
- **Default retention**: 7 days (168 hours)
- **Time travel impact**: Cannot time travel past vacuumed files
- **Concurrent safety**: Safe to run with concurrent reads/writes
- **Storage optimization**: Removes unused files to reduce costs

### 5. Advanced Time Travel Analytics

#### **Data Evolution Tracking**
```python
# Compare metrics across versions
v0_stats = df_v0.agg({"amount": "count", "amount": "avg"}).collect()[0]
v_current_stats = df_current.agg({"amount": "count", "amount": "avg"}).collect()[0]

growth_rate = ((v_current_stats[0] - v0_stats[0]) / v0_stats[0]) * 100
print(f"Data growth: {growth_rate:.1f}%")
```

#### **Schema Evolution Analysis**
```python
# Track schema changes
v0_columns = set(df_v0.columns)
current_columns = set(df_current.columns)

new_columns = current_columns - v0_columns
print(f"New columns added: {list(new_columns)}")
```

#### **Audit Trail Creation**
```python
# Create comprehensive audit log
audit_df = history_df.select(
    "version", "timestamp", "operation",
    col("operationMetrics.numTargetRowsUpdated").alias("rows_updated"),
    col("operationMetrics.numTargetRowsDeleted").alias("rows_deleted")
)
```

## Running the Demo

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables (Optional)
```bash
export MINIO_ENDPOINT="http://24.144.65.249:80"
export MINIO_ACCESS_KEY="miniolake"
export MINIO_SECRET_KEY="LakE142536@@"
```

### Step 2: Execute the Demo
```bash
docker exec -it spark-master /opt/bitnami/spark/bin/spark-submit \
  --master spark://spark-master:7077 \
  /opt/bitnami/spark/jobs/spark/mod-4/demo-3.py
```

### Step 3: Monitor Execution
Watch for:
- ‚úÖ Version creation progress (0 ‚Üí 4)
- ‚è∞ Time travel query results
- üìú History analysis output
- üîÑ Restore operation status
- üßπ VACUUM operation results

## Expected Output

The demo creates a multi-version table showing data evolution:

```
Version 0: Initial load (100 records)
Version 1: Append operation (200 total records)  
Version 2: Update operation (price adjustments)
Version 3: Schema evolution (new column added)
Version 4: Delete operation (filtered records)
```

## Key Concepts Learned

### Time Travel Architecture
```
Table Versions:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Version 0: 00000000000000000000.json (Initial)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Version 1: 00000000000000000001.json (Append) 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Version 2: 00000000000000000002.json (Update)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Version 3: 00000000000000000003.json (Delete)

Data Files:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ part-00000-v0.parquet (Version 0 data)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ part-00001-v1.parquet (Version 1 new data)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ part-00002-v2.parquet (Version 2 updated data)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [Previous files still available for time travel]
```

### Version Retention Strategy
- **Short-term**: Keep all versions for debugging (hours/days)
- **Medium-term**: Retain major versions for compliance (weeks)
- **Long-term**: Archive critical snapshots (months/years)
- **Cost optimization**: Balance storage costs vs. time travel needs

### Performance Considerations
- **Time travel overhead**: Reading old versions may be slower
- **Metadata growth**: More versions = larger transaction log
- **Storage costs**: Old files consume storage until vacuumed
- **Query planning**: Spark optimizes based on available statistics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Version Not Found**
   ```
   VersionNotFoundException: Version 5 not found
   ```
   **Solution**: Check available versions with `DESCRIBE HISTORY`

2. **Files Not Found After VACUUM**
   ```
   FileNotFoundException: File has been deleted
   ```
   **Solution**: Version vacuumed beyond retention period

3. **Concurrent Modification During RESTORE**
   ```
   ConcurrentModificationException: Table modified during restore
   ```
   **Solution**: Ensure no concurrent writes during restore operation

4. **VACUUM Permission Issues**
   ```
   AccessDeniedException: Cannot delete files
   ```
   **Solution**: Check S3 permissions for delete operations

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Time Travel Comparison Analysis
**Objective**: Compare business metrics across different time periods.

**Tasks**:
1. Create a table with sales data over multiple days
2. Simulate daily batch updates (new sales + price changes)
3. Use time travel to compare:
   - Daily sales volumes
   - Average order values  
   - Customer behavior changes
4. Create a trend analysis showing evolution over time
5. Identify the version with highest revenue

**Expected Outcome**:
```
Day 1 (Version 0): 150 orders, $45.50 avg
Day 2 (Version 1): 280 orders, $52.30 avg  
Day 3 (Version 2): 310 orders, $48.90 avg
Peak performance: Version 2 with $15,159 total revenue
```

### Exercise 2: Data Recovery Simulation
**Objective**: Practice recovery from data corruption scenarios.

**Tasks**:
1. Create a stable baseline version (Version 0)
2. Apply several legitimate updates (Versions 1-3)
3. Simulate data corruption by applying bad updates (Version 4)
4. Use `DESCRIBE HISTORY` to identify the corruption point
5. Restore to the last known good version
6. Verify data integrity after restore
7. Document the recovery process

**Recovery Scenario**:
```sql
-- Identify corruption
DESCRIBE HISTORY delta.`table_path`

-- Restore to last good version
RESTORE TABLE delta.`table_path` TO VERSION AS OF 3

-- Verify restoration
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM delta.`table_path`
```

### Exercise 3: Storage Optimization Strategy
**Objective**: Develop an optimal VACUUM strategy.

**Tasks**:
1. Create a table with frequent updates over several versions
2. Analyze storage growth using `DESCRIBE DETAIL`
3. Run `VACUUM DRY RUN` with different retention periods:
   - 0 hours (aggressive cleanup)
   - 24 hours (daily retention)  
   - 168 hours (weekly retention)
4. Compare storage savings vs. time travel capabilities
5. Implement an optimal VACUUM schedule
6. Test time travel limitations after each VACUUM

**Analysis Points**:
- How much storage is saved with each retention period?
- What versions become inaccessible after VACUUM?
- What's the optimal balance for your use case?

### Exercise 4: Schema Evolution Audit
**Objective**: Track and document schema changes over time.

**Tasks**:
1. Start with a simple table schema
2. Apply progressive schema changes:
   - Add nullable columns
   - Add columns with default values
   - Rename columns (via recreate)
   - Change data types (where possible)
3. Use time travel to analyze schema at each version
4. Create a schema evolution report showing:
   - When each change occurred
   - What columns were added/modified
   - Impact on existing data
5. Test backward compatibility by reading old versions

**Schema Evolution Report**:
```
Version 0: [id, name, email] - baseline schema
Version 1: [id, name, email, phone] - added phone
Version 2: [id, name, email, phone, status] - added status with default
Version 3: [id, full_name, email, phone, status] - renamed name to full_name
```

### Exercise 5: Advanced Audit Trail Implementation
**Objective**: Build a comprehensive audit system using time travel.

**Tasks**:
1. Create a sensitive data table (customer information)
2. Implement audit logging for all operations:
   - Who made changes (user identification)
   - When changes occurred (timestamps)
   - What changed (operation details)
   - How many records affected (metrics)
3. Use the History API to build audit reports:
   - Daily change summary
   - User activity report
   - Data volume trends
   - Risk assessment (large deletions/updates)
4. Create alerts for suspicious activities
5. Demonstrate compliance reporting capabilities

**Audit Report Example**:
```python
def generate_audit_report(table_path, start_date, end_date):
    """Generate comprehensive audit report"""
    history_df = delta_table.history()
    
    # Filter by date range
    period_changes = history_df.filter(
        (col("timestamp") >= start_date) & 
        (col("timestamp") <= end_date)
    )
    
    # Summarize activities
    summary = period_changes.groupBy("operation", "userName") \
        .agg(count("*").alias("operation_count"))
    
    return summary
```

## Best Practices
